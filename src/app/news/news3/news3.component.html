          Садржај:
          <br> GeoGebra (http://geogebra.org), a free, open-source, dynamic mathematics software, is rapidly gaining
          popularity in the teaching and learning of mathematics around the world. Currently, GeoGebra is used
          by approximately 20 million students and teachers, translated to 62 languages, used in 190 countries,
          and downloaded by approximately 500,000 users in each month,and clearly making an impact on mathematics
          education in most countries. This increased use compelled the establishment of the International GeoGebra
          Institute (IGI) that serves as a virtual organization to support local GeoGebra initiatives and institutes.
          There are already 143 institutes in 85 countries, which pursue training and support of teachers, develop
          teaching materials, and carry out research projects. In my talk, I will review examples of applications
          of GeoGebra at different levels of education from around the world. The capabilities of GeoGebra are
          now extended to other subject areas such as physics, chemistry, engineering etc. and will show some examples
          of development in these areas. In addition, I will outline our plans to work together with different
          countries to enhance mathematics and STEM (Science, Technolgy, Engineering, Mathematics) in their educational
          systems. Кратка биографија предавача:

          Dr Zsolt Lavicza, Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge
        </p>
        <p>
          After receiving his degrees in mathematics and physics in Hungary, Zsolt began his postgraduate studies in
          applied mathematics.
          While teaching several mathematics courses at the University of Cincinnati he became interested in researching
          issues in the teaching and learning mathematics. In particular, he focused on investigating issues in
          relation to the use of technology in undergraduate mathematics education. Since then both at the University
          of Michigan and Cambridge, he has worked on several research projects examining technology and mathematics
          teaching in a variety of classroom environments. Currently, Zsolt is working as an Associate Lecturer
          in Mathematics Education at the University of Cambridge as well as he is coordinating the development
          of local GeoGebra Institutes and offering research support within the International GeoGebra Institute.
